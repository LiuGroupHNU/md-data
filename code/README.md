# About DeePMD-kit
DeePMD-kit is a package written in Python/C++, designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning-based model of interatomic potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics (MD). This brings new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems.

For more information, check the [documentation](https://deepmd.readthedocs.io/).


## Highlighted features
* **interfaced with TensorFlow**, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient, in addition, Tensorboard can be used to visualize training procedures.
* **interfaced with high-performance classical MD packages**, i.e., LAMMPS.
* **implements the Deep Potential series models**, which have been successfully applied to finite and extended systems including organic molecules, metals, semiconductors, insulators, etc.
* **implements MPI and GPU supports**, making it highly efficient for high-performance parallel and distributed computing.
* **highly modularized**, easy to adapt to different descriptors for deep learning-based potential energy models.

# Download and install

Please follow our [GitHub](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) webpage to download the [latest released version](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/tree/master) and [development version](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/tree/devel).

DeePMD-kit offers multiple installation methods. It is recommended to use easy methods like [offline packages](doc/install/easy-install.md#offline-packages), [conda](doc/install/easy-install.md#with-conda) and [docker](doc/install/easy-install.md#with-docker).

One may manually install DeePMD-kit by following the instructions on [installing the Python interface](doc/install/install-from-source.md#install-the-python-interface) and [installing the C++ interface](doc/install/install-from-source.md#install-the-c-interface). The C++ interface is necessary when using DeePMD-kit with LAMMPS.


# Use DeePMD-kit

A quick start on using DeePMD-kit can be found [here](doc/getting-started/quick_start.ipynb).

A full [document](doc/train/train-input-auto.rst) on options in the training input script is available.
